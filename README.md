Warning: On initial run the Python needs to create the test.db file (as it was too large to store in the git), this is a process that takes usually around one hour and only has to happen once. Once test.db exists and is full with correct data there will be no issues regarding insanely long times to start the web server.

To start the Flask website try running the run.py file, you will need to keep installing all the needed dependencies so look them up as the errors come up. Once its running all the way this means that you are good and should have no dependecy issues.
